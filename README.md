# Next.js API Routes Data Fetching in Client Component

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when fetching data from API routes within client components in Next.js. The error arises when attempting to use `await` directly within the component's body, causing a runtime issue due to the client-side rendering context.

## Problem
The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/data`) using `await` within the component. This is problematic because client components are rendered on the client-side, and `await` requires a synchronous context. 

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions to fetch the data during the build process or at request time.  These asynchronous data fetching methods handle the `await` correctly within a server-side context.
